# Supported registers

This page lists the current device-family support surface by PLC profile.

Profile-specific device-number ranges still depend on the PLC model, module
parameters, and user program. The example addresses below show parser syntax;
they are not range limits.

## Common rules

| Rule | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Plain device strings | The high-level parser accepts plain device strings such as `D100`, `M100`, `X10`, `W100`, and `LZ0`. |
| Standalone `G` / `HG` | Not plain devices for any profile. Use qualified forms such as `Un\G` or `Un\HG` only when the selected profile supports that route. |
| `S` device | Not supported by this serial MC library. |
| Link-direct devices | Use the dedicated `Jn\...` link-direct APIs when the selected profile supports them. |
| Qualified unit access | Use the native-qualified `Un\G` / `Un\HG` APIs when the selected profile supports them. The `0601/1601` helper route is profile/target-specific and must not be used as a fallback. |

| Plain word read/write | `D`, `SD`, `W`, `TN`, `STN`, `CN`, `SW`, `Z`, `R` |
| Long counter state read/write | `LCS`, `LCC`; reads use the long-state helper |

Native random read on the tested Q target is narrower than batch access for
some timer/counter status families. Treat random-read rejection as a command
route limitation, not as a batch-read exclusion.

### `melsec:lcpu`

| Native-qualified read/write | `Un\G` |
| Expected but not locally confirmed | `Jn\X`, `Jn\Y`, `Jn\B`, `Jn\W`, `Jn\SB`, `Jn\SW` |
| Not supported | `S`, `LTS`, `LTC`, `LSTS`, `LSTC`, `LCS`, `LCC`, `LTN`, `LSTN`, `LCN`, `LZ`, `RD`, `Un\HG` |

Native random read on the tested L target is narrower than batch access for
some timer/counter status families. Treat random-read rejection as a command
route limitation, not as a batch-read exclusion.

### `melsec:qna`, `melsec:ana-anu`, and `melsec:a`

These profiles select older command families and are maintained by
manual-derived inference and codec-level tests until matching hardware is
available. Do not promote a device inventory for these profiles without target
evidence.

`melsec:a` is required for A-series extended file-register `ER/EW` paths.
`melsec:qna` or `melsec:ana-anu` is required for QnA/AnA/AnU command-family
paths such as direct extended file-register access.

## Addressing notes

| Topic | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Plain device string | Supported for profile-allowed plain devices. |
| Hexadecimal address families | `X`, `Y`, `B`, `W`, `SB`, `SW`, `DX`, and `DY` parse their numeric part as hexadecimal. |
| `:D` / `:F` suffix | Not supported by the current high-level parser. Use typed C++ fields such as `double_word` where available. |
| `.n` bit-in-word suffix | Not supported by the current high-level parser. |
| Long timer/counter state reads | Use `read_long_state_bits()` for supported long-state families. |
| Link-direct access | Use the `read_link_direct_*()` / `write_link_direct_*()` helpers for supported `Jn\...` families. |
| Qualified unit access | Use `read_native_qualified_words()` / `write_native_qualified_words()` for supported `Un\G` / `Un\HG` families. |
| Trace logging | Set `MCPROTOCOL_SERIAL_TRACE=1` with the synchronous host client to log MC TX/RX frame bytes. |
