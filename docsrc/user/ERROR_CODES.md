# Error codes

This page is a practical guide for errors returned by this library and by
MELSEC serial MC Protocol targets. It is not a complete Mitsubishi error-code
table. Use the PLC and serial-module manuals for formal definitions.

## Library status codes

Most public APIs return `mcprotocol::serial::Status`.

When `status.code == StatusCode::PlcError`, the target returned a PLC or
serial-module error response and `status.plc_error_code` contains the numeric
code observed on the wire.

| Status code | Typical meaning | First checks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Timeout` | No complete response arrived before the response timeout. | Check wiring, baud rate, parity, stop bits, station number, and whether the PLC module is configured for the same frame type. |
| `Framing` | Bytes arrived, but they did not match the selected response frame. | Check 1C/2C/3C/4C/1E selection, ASCII format, binary vs ASCII mode, and CR/LF settings. |
| `SumCheckMismatch` | A response arrived, but its sum-check did not match. | Check whether sum-check is enabled on both sides. If it is, check serial noise and wiring. |
| `Parse` | The response frame shape was recognized, but a numeric field or payload length could not be decoded. | Capture the raw frame and check whether the selected frame/profile matches the PLC setting. |
| `UnsupportedConfiguration` | The request cannot be encoded for the selected profile, frame, or build options. | Select an explicit `PlcProfile`, choose a supported frame helper, and check disabled feature macros. |
| `PlcError` | The PLC or serial module returned an error response. | Read `status.plc_error_code` and use the sections below. |

## PLC and serial-module error families

Serial MC Protocol uses more than one error-code family. Do not interpret every
code as an SLMP Ethernet end code.

| Code family | Where it appears | How to handle it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU-side `4000`-series and related PLC end codes | QnA extended `3C` / `4C` routes when the request reaches the CPU. | Use the shared SLMP-style end-code guide for practical checks: <https://fa-yoshinobu.github.io/plc-comm-docs-site/slmp/profile-reference/troubleshooting-end-codes/>. |
| `7Fxx` serial-module responses | Serial-module rejection before or around CPU forwarding. | Treat as target/module dependent. Check frame mode, profile, device family, route, and module settings. Only observed cases are documented here. |
| `1C` NAK codes | Legacy `1C` A-compatible / QnA-compatible frames. | Not yet published as a user table. Record the raw response and target settings; deliberately malformed-request measurements are still a TODO. |
| No response | The module ignores the request or cannot answer in the selected mode. | Treat as a transport/configuration problem first, not as an error code. |

## Observed codes

Only project-observed cases are listed here. If you see a code not listed here,
record the raw response, frame kind, ASCII/binary mode, station, sum-check
setting, PLC model, serial module, and selected PLC profile.

| Code | Observed situation | Practical check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x4031` | CPU-side device or route rejection observed on serial paths, for example unsupported link-direct access on a target setup. | Check the selected profile, route notation, mounted module, and whether the requested device family exists on that PLC. |
| `0x7F22` | Serial-module rejection observed for unsupported serial-MC device/command shapes, such as `S` device probes on a C24 path before CPU forwarding. | Do not treat unsupported device families as valid access paths. Recheck the profile support table and the serial-module MC protocol format. |

## Codes intentionally not expanded yet

The decoder preserves error codes such as two-digit `1C` NAK codes and
four-digit QnA serial responses, but this page does not assign meanings to
unmeasured codes.

The active TODO is to collect live-device evidence for:

- `1C` NAK codes from deliberately malformed but transmitted requests.
- `3C` / `4C` serial-link `7Fxx` codes from deliberately malformed serial
  requests.

After those measurements exist, add only observed codes to this page.
